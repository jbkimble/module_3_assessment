# As a user
# After I have searched a zip code for stores
# When I click the name of a store
# Then my current path should be "/stores/:store_id"
# I should see the store name, store type and address with city, state and zip
# I should see an unordered list of the store hours in the following format:
#   * Mon: 10am-9pm

#   * Thurs: 10am-9pm
